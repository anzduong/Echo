### Echo
#### by An Duong


## Overview
The year is 2045. Five years ago, Cache Enterprise released a memory recording device, Echo, that took the United States by storm. Millions of people have purchased Echo and use it daily. The beta version started out as a wireless camera, taking photos through signals sent by the user’s brainwaves. It has now evolved to have memory recording capabilities. The clips/video can be max 8 hours long or as short as a few seconds. The device can be connected to a phone/computer/etc via bluetooth. Memories can then be uploaded to a cloud where the user can look back on their life experiences. This device is privately owned with the promise to protect the rights and privacy of its users. The government cannot force memories to be handed over without consent. 

## Technical Overview
